            Implement a thorough review process for adoption applications to
            ensure that dogs are placed in suitable homes. This may involve
            assessing factors such as the adopters living situation, and their
            ability to provide proper care and attention to a dog. A
            comprehensive review process helps ensure the well-being and safety
            of the animals.

            Focus on personalized matching between dogs and potential adopters.
            Take into account factors such as the adopters and the dogs
            temperament and needs. By matching dogs with compatible adopters,
            you increase the likelihood of successful adoptions and reduce the
            risk of dogs being returned to the shelter or rescue organization.
